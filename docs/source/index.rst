Rambling Realms Trading Platform documentation
==============================================

This app is made to streamline the training, testing, and deploying of machine learning based trading applications (Quant Trading). The end-goal of the application is to provide a hyper generic pipeline for interchanging models, features, training configurations, and strategies all from the command line. The goal of this project is not to outpace existing high frequency trading platforms which leverage low latency, high volume signals, but instead identify long term trends utilizing OHLCV data, sentiment data, gov data, value investment scores, and additional features. You can think of this project more as a full time financial advisor than a trading bot.
